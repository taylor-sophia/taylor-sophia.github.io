<p> Starting my wordpress website was a bit of a challenge. I had some trouble navigating and figuring out how to place certain elements. Once I got the hang of it, I enjoyed the process a lot more. This was my first time creating a portfolio for my work and having almost complete control over the design aspects. It was fun to customize my pages and incorporate some of my personality into the portfolio. This is a great tool for any student who wants to showcase their work and include their resume and contact info in one place.</p>

<p> Tips and Tricks
    <ul>
        <li> Play around with the website before jumping into the project. It may take some time to figure out if you've never done anything like this before. </li>
        <li> Make your design consistent. Try to match up the design elements of your projects and resume with the theme and color palette of your portfolio. </li>
    </ul>
