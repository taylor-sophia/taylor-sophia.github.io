<p> Arguably three of the most challenging yet rewarding projects of the semester. Learning to code HTML and CSS is like learning a new language; you have to remember many rules or your project will fall apart. There were many times where my code failed and I struggled to understand why, but resolving the issue and seeing my finished work felt very rewarding. I was able to pick up HTML pretty easily, but CSS was difficult for me. There are still some aspects of CSS that I can't entirely grasp, but as I go further into my web design journey I am hoping I will learn and improve.</p>
<p> Tips and Tricks</p>
<ul>
    <li>Remember your opening and closing tags! This determines if your code will work. It seems like a simple mistake, but it happens.</li>
<li>Utilize websites like <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">w3schools</a> and <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/">FreeCodeCamp.</a> These websites are life savers when you can't remember how to code a certain element.</li>
<li> Use the comment code to leave notes to yourself. This will help you pick up where you left off or help you remember why you used a certain code  </li>
<li>Save your old coding projects to refer to when you are stuck.</li>
<li>Practice! </li>
</ul>
