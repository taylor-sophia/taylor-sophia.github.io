    <li>Cats have 230 bones, while humans only have 206</li>
    <li>Cats have the largest eyes relative to their head size of any mammal</li>

These behaviors include scent marking by scratching, prey play, prey stalking, pouncing, chinning, and urine marking.</li>
    <li>Cats are believed to be the only mammals who don't taste sweetness.</li>

    <h1>Why You Should Stop ‘Gamifying’ Your Health and Fitness</h1>
    <h4>You don't need to chase a fake goal to be able to chase a real goal.</h4>

    <p>By Beth Skwarecki</p>

    <img src="fitness.jpg" width="800" height="650" alt="woman running">

    <p>Real life doesn’t require fake metrics. You don’t need to rack up XP, because you’re gaining actual experience. You don’t need a fake quest, because you’re on a real quest. Whether that’s deadlifting 500 pounds or seeing better cholesterol numbers the next time you go to the doctor, your health habits have real-world rewards and consequences.</p>
<p>So let’s look at some of the ways gamification of health habits can backfire. Lifehacker staff writer Stephen Johnson explains the most common game tactics here, and that’s worth a read if you haven’t checked it out yet. Gamification is usually just manipulation, and it often has more downsides than benefits.</p>
<h3>Aim for consistency, not streaks</h3>
<p>Streaks entertain you during good times with the explicit goal of heaping disappointment on you when you slip up. And they’re a particularly harmful type of misdirection, because people easily become more focused on the streak than on whatever reason they were doing the streak in the first place.</p>
<p>Consistency in the long term is what matters to your body. Streaks only matter to app developers. Why do you think the Apple Watch wants you standing for 12 hours each day? It’s so you wear their watch during all your waking hours. The “stand” goal is programmed into the app because it benefits Apple, not you.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Running a local 5K, and trying to finish in the top X percent of your age group.</li>
    <li>Competing in something like a powerlifting meet, where you try to put up the best possible total on meet day.</li>
    <li>Joining a recreational sports league, and getting to know the members of your softball/soccer/pickleball team while either crushing the competition or commiserating about your inability to do so.</li>
</ul>
